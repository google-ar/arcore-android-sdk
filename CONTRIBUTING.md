# How to Contribute

We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to the source code included
in this project. There are just a few small guidelines you need to follow.

## Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License
Agreement. You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your contribution;
this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as
part of the project. Head over to <https://cla.developers.google.com/> to see
your current agreements on file or to sign a new one.

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one
(even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it
again.

## Code reviews

Although we do not use the normal GitHub pull request process to incorporate
contributions, it's okay to send us pull requests. Once we have received your
CLA we will review and consider your contribution for inclusion in a future
release of the SDK.

## Community Guidelines

This project follows
[Google's Open Source Community
Guidelines](https://opensource.google.com/conduct/).
