ARCore SDK for Android
======================
Copyright 2017 Google LLC

This SDK provides APIs for all of the essential AR features like motion
tracking, environmental understanding, and light estimation. With these
capabilities you can build entirely new AR experiences or enhance existing apps
with AR features.

## Main difference to upstream

It provieds a all-in-one sample, and installed apk from release will update your apk an new releases. 
Github works similar to Google playstore as apk provider

## API Reference

or [ARCore SDK for C API Reference](//developers.google.com/ar/reference/c).


## Release Notes

The SDK release notes are available on the
[releases](//github.com/google-ar/arcore-android-sdk/releases) page.


## Terms & Conditions

By downloading the ARCore SDK for Android, you agree that the
[Google APIs Terms of Service](//developers.google.com/terms/) governs your use
thereof.


## User privacy requirements

You must disclose the use of Google Play Services for AR (ARCore) and how it
collects and processes data, prominently in your application, easily accessible
to users. You can do this by adding the following text on your main menu or
notice screen: "This application runs on [Google Play Services for AR](//play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.ar.core) (ARCore),
which is provided by Google LLC and governed by the [Google Privacy Policy](//policies.google.com/privacy)".

## Deprecation policy

Apps built with **ARCore SDK 1.12.0 or higher** are covered by the
[Cloud Anchor API deprecation policy](//developers.google.com/ar/distribute/deprecation-policy).

Apps built with **ARCore SDK 1.11.0 or lower** will be unable to host or resolve
Cloud Anchors beginning December 2020 due to the SDK's use of an older,
deprecated ARCore Cloud Anchor service.
